CORE PRINCIPLES:

1. START WITH THE CUSTOMER
   - Lead with customer pain points, not product features
   - Quantify customer problems with specific metrics
   - Show measurable customer outcomes (before/after comparisons)
   - Include real customer voices with quantitative results

2. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - Every benefit must have a number: percentage, time saved, cost reduced
   - Use before/after comparisons: "from X to Y"
   - Include customer success metrics with specific data
   - Provide ROI or value metrics where applicable

3. AUTHENTIC EVIDENCE
   - 2-3 customer quotes with real names, titles, companies
   - Each quote must include specific, measurable outcomes
   - Format: "We achieved [specific metric]" - Name, Title, Company
   - Example: "Cut onboarding time from 2 weeks to 3 days" - Sarah Johnson, VP Operations

4. TECHNICAL CREDIBILITY
   - Explain the mechanism: HOW does it work?
   - Include architecture, workflow, or process details
